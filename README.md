Abstract

This project implements an on-premise, retrieval-augmented decision support system designed for Maharashtra Government / BMC-style administrative use cases. The system ingests statutory Acts (JSON) and reference documents (PDFs), converts them into structured semantic embeddings, and enables controlled, auditable, and conservative policy reasoning.

The system does not approve, reject, or recommend actions. Instead, it assists officers by retrieving relevant legal provisions, clearly separating what can be concluded, what cannot be concluded, and what requires further confirmation, ensuring defensible decision-making under policy ambiguity.

Key outcomes achieved:
Large-scale ingestion of statutory and contextual documents
Authority-aware metadata tagging (statutory vs contextual)
Persistent vector database for fast semantic retrieval
Conservative RAG responses with explicit limitations
Modular, production-ready code structure suitable for team testing

🔧 Prerequisites
Python 3.9+
Virtual environment support
GROQ API key (for LLM inference)

🚀 Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ayushvakani/policy-rag
cd policy-rag
2️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file at the project root:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
5️⃣ Add Data
data/
├── pdf_files/     # PDFs (manuals, reports, reference docs)
└── json_files/    # Acts, rules, circulars (structured JSON)

📥 One-Time Ingestion Step
⚠️ This step can take significant time depending on data size.
python -m app.ingest.ingest_documents

▶️ Running the System
After ingestion is complete:
python main.py

You should see:
System ready.
Documents: <count>
Enter query (or 'exit'):
